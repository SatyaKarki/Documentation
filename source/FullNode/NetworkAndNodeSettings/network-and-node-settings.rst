Specifying node and network settings 
***************************************************************

When it comes to individual settings Stratis Full Node is very configurable. Probably the most important settings relate to the network, and it is these settings that you can use to configure your own sidechain or mainchain network. This includes the creation of the genesis block,

This documents follows from :doc:`../Features/features>`, which pull features into a full node. This material details the configurfable values, which further define how these features will operate within the Full Node. For example, there is a setting that defines the maximum block size, and the consensus rules use this to check that the size of a block has not been exceeded.
