**************************************************
Getting started with sidechain-compatible wallets
**************************************************

If you want to fund the sidechain, then you must run each of the following before you can begin depositing and withdrawing funds: 

1. A standard Stratis Full Node daemon to support a Stratis Core wallet.
2. A special version of the Stratis Core wallet with built-in sidechains functionality.
3. A Full Sidechain Node daemon to support an APEX core wallet.
4. An APEX Core wallet.

The following sections expand on what you must do get each item from the above table up and running. A user who just wants to make transactions on the sidechain only needs to set up items 3 and 4.
