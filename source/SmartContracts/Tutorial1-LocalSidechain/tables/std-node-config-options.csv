sidechain,Specifies to run a sidechain miner. As mentioned before because this local sidechain is not pegged to STRAT this miner does not have a corresponding node running on the Stratis mainchain. This option takes advantage of the Full Node flexibility when it comes to building in features. The option includes a different feature set to the mainchain federated peg node.  
datadir,Specifies where to hold the data for miner1. This includes… On a Mac this is ~/LocalSCNodes/miner1. This overrides the standard settings which assume you will only run one node for each mainchain or sidechain on a machine. In this slightly unusual situation three nodes from one sidechain are run on one machine. 
port,Specifies the port to use to interact with peers on the network.
apiport,Specifies the port to use for interactions via the Swagger API.
publickey,Specify the public key for the miner. This key is broadcast to the network and is used during consensus to confirm that blocks have been mined by this miner. 
mincoinmaturity,Specifies the minimum block confirmations required for coins to be added to withdrawals.
mindepositconfirmations,Specifies the minimum block confirmations required for coins to be added to withdrawals.
txindex,A flag that specifies that transactions should be saved in the database so they can be queried.
redeemscript,The script to authorize withdrawals out of the sidechain. This just has to be present and is not used in this set up.
connect,Specifies the peers to conenct to on the network. The miner makes no attempt to connet to other peers on this network.
bind,The IP address to accept data from. Specifying a local address ensures that the network remains entirely local.
