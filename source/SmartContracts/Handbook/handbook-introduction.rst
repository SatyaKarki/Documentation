Smart Contracts Handbook
####################################

This handbook provides some basic theory about smart contracts, explores some use cases, and provides reference material including a breakdown of an interesting real-world smart contract. The handbook is referenced from the tutorials, but it can also be read from "cover to cover". You may want to read the handbook through after you have had some hands-on experience deploying your first smart contract.
