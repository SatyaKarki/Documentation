<div class="section" id="security">
<h2>Security<a class="headerlink" href="#security" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Internet represents an insecure channel for exchanging information leading to high risk of intrusion or fraud. The objective is to establish rules and measures to use against attacks on transactions made over the Internet. Internet security is a top priority for both businesses and governments. Good Internet security protects transactional and all sensitive and personal details handled by a business or agency’s servers and network hardware. Insufficient Internet security can threaten to collapse any operation where data gets routed over the Web.</p>
<p>The blockchain keeps your data safe through the use of cryptography to code and decode messages, digital signatures, private and public keys, to access that data, and the  Immutable nature of the append only database that is a blockchain. Once confirmed, a transaction cannot be reversed. Only users with access to keys are allowed to create transactions from previous balances, and no one can interfere with a completed transfer. These strengths provide benefits for audit. Providers and recipients of data can be sure that data has not been altered. These benefits are not only useful for databases of financial transactions, but all digital transactions over the internet.</p>
<p>Decentralization is the transfer of decision making power and assignment of accountability and responsibility to all involved parties for results. Decentralization is achieved via a <strong>Peer to Peer network</strong> that relies on a host of computers. It physically cannot work with a single computer or point-of-connection. Instead, it requires a slew of other computers to join in, in order to complete a specific task on the network.</p>
<p>Vitalik:</p>
<p>Three reasons to be decentralized:
* Fault tolerance— decentralized systems are less likely to fail accidentally because they rely on many separate components that are not likely.
* Attack resistance— decentralized systems are more expensive to attack and destroy or manipulate because they lack sensitive central points that can be     attacked at much lower cost than the economic size of the surrounding system.
* Collusion resistance — it is much harder for participants in decentralized systems to collude to act in ways that benefit them at the expense of other     participants, whereas the leaderships of corporations and governments collude in ways that benefit themselves but harm less well-coordinated citizens,     customers, employees and the general public all the time.</p>
<p>“Blockchains are politically decentralized (no one controls them) and architecturally decentralized (no infrastructural central point of failure) but they are logically centralized (there is one commonly agreed state and the system behaves like a single computer)”
-Vitalik</p>

<div class="section" id="privacy">
<h2>Privacy<a class="headerlink" href="#privacy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Internet privacy concerns the rights and policies related with data that can be used to identify an individual; specifically, storing, repurposing, provision to third parties, and displaying of said information. The categories of data are Personally Identifying Information (PII) or non-PII, information such as a site visitors behavior on a website.
Blockchain does not require a users identity to securely function in the network. A pseudonym or alias is a name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their true name or identifying details. With techniques like <strong>digital signatures</strong>, <strong>cryptography</strong> and <strong>hashing</strong>, privacy of the user can be maintained with an address being used as a pseudonym.
In further iterations of blockchain technology, once a user decides to share PII or non-PII, that user will have full control of who can see and use this information, very different from the current situation with 3rd party applications selling your information off to the highest bidder.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="transparency">
<h2>Transparency<a class="headerlink" href="#transparency" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The blockchain is a public registry of who owns what and who transacted what. This auditable, shared ledger make it is possible for anyone to track the movement of transactions and resulting balances throughout the network.
By using a block explorer like: <a class="reference external" href="https://chainz.cryptoid.info/strat/">https://chainz.cryptoid.info/strat/</a> you can track a multitude of details; track an address to see what transactions it has made and to what addressess, you can see a breakdown of token ownership throughout the network down to the “rich list” or biggest owner of tokens of that blockchain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="trustlessness">
<h2>Trustlessness<a class="headerlink" href="#trustlessness" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Trust is the cornerstone of any transaction. Knowing you will receive what is expected from the party you are making the agreement with has always required a middle man to perform tasks such as holding assets in escrow or verifying identities. With the blockchain, trust is established through mass collaboration and clever code rather than through a powerful institution that does the authentication and the settlement. Cryptography and consensus are two of the features of blockchain which make trust issues a thing of the past when transacting safely.</p>
