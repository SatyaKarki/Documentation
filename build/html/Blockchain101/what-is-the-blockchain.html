<h1>What is the blockchain?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-blockchain" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>“The Internet 3.0”.</p>
<p>The blockchain is a network and a database with rules written in code that allow users to manage it, without the need for a trusted middleman.
It is a <em>decentralized ledger</em> that is validated and secured by a network of peer to peer nodes.</p>
<p><strong>Blockchain</strong> :according to Wikipedia
A blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. Constantly growing as ‘completed’ blocks (the most recent transactions) are recorded and added to it in chronological order, it allows market participants to keep track of digital currency transactions without central recordkeeping. Each node (a computer connected to the network) gets a copy of the blockchain, which is downloaded automatically.</p>
<p>Imagine a global spreadsheet that runs on every users computer and follows a protocol containing the set of rules governing the validity of data as it gets written to the blockchain and propagated across the network. Those entries to the blockchain are then verified by the <strong>nodes</strong> in the system, and the entries are linked to their source for a simple and effective history validation.</p>
<p>The revolutionary feature of distributed ledger technology is that the ledger is not maintained by any central authority. Updates to the ledger are independently constructed and recorded by each node. The nodes then vote on these updates to ensure that the majority agrees with the conclusion reached. This voting and agreement on one copy of the ledger is called <strong>consensus</strong>, and is conducted automatically by a consensus algorithm.</p>
<p>The three main functions of a distributed ledger:
1. <strong>Decentralized</strong>: the ledger is on the computer of every user that participates in the system.
2. <strong>Transparent</strong>: Users have full access to review transactions from the beginning for purposes of information validation and transaction verification.
3. <strong>Record</strong>: Data is written, time stamped, and cannot be changed once accepted by the network.</p>
<p>The blockchain is more than a distributed ledger. It employs a chain of blocks filled with transaction that are linked to previous transactions and blocks with the use of hashes, and using <em>cryptography</em> to facilitate validation and verification.
Blockchains organize data in blocks, then update and propagate the entries using an append-only structure that is agreed upon via consensus by all <em>nodes</em> in the <em>peer to peer</em> network.</p>

<h2>Who created blockchain?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-created-blockchain" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first reference of blockchain came in the Bitcoin whitepaper, 2008, by mystery founder Satoshi Nakamoto. The Bitcoin protocol launched in 2009, establishing for the first time the viability of transferring value on a peer-to-peer basis over the internet, without the need for a trusted intermediary. Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, solved the ‘double spend’ problem: the issue that digital information can easily be copied, and therefore a centralised authority was previously required to reflect where funds were located.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin and further:<a class="headerlink" href="#bitcoin-and-further" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Although Bitcoin is very successful at transferring value and is an effective form of decentralised money, from the outset, it was recognised that the same approach could be used to record information of almost any kind on the same shared basis. As well as cash, strings of characters on the blockchain could represent simple messages, ownership of physical or digital assets or securities, voting decisions, and so on. This broader application was developed by a number of ‘2.0’ platforms including Nxt and BitShares, amongst others. To date, however, all of these have been relatively limited in one way or another, and lack suitability in their current forms for adoption by real-world financial businesses.</p>
